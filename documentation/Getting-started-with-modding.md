## Getting started with modding
This guide will help you get started with the ND modding tool. This tool is also used by the developers to create content altough their version is more advanced.

### Set up the modding tool:
- Download Unity hub
- Go to installs in unity hub (4th menu item on the left)
- Click on 'add' on the top-right and install unity 2020.1.13f1. You have to visit the online archive for this. A link in the 'add' window will take you to the unity website. You can find the version there and there will be a link to open it in unity hub.
- Copy the 'Resources' folder from 'nearly_dead_data' folder in the nearly dead game folder to ND_Modding_Tool/assets
- In unity hub, go to 'projects' (first menu item on the left)
- Click 'Add' and select the ND_Modding_Tool folder
- Click on ND_Modding_Tool in unity hub and unity will start and you're ready.
